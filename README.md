fork Microsoft.Toolkit.Parsers from https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit

## important
I am using [Microsoft.Toolkit.Parsers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Toolkit.Parsers).

But it was marked as legacy and no longer maintained someday and it's code is even deleted from origin repository.

Since the code use MIT license, I decided to pick it up from history commits and place it here.

I renamed the package name and publish it to nuget.org for further use.

I will continue to maintain this project as long as i am a programmer.

Thanks for the origin authors of Microsoft.Toolkit.Parsers from .NET Foundation and Contributors.
